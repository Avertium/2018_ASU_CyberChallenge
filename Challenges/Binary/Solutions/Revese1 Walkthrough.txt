04_Sea_Of_Text Walkthrough

Play with the application at least once before trying to reverse it. When ran, the program asks for a password. If the incorrect password is entered, it prints "Fail!" and exits. In software, there are multiple ways to compare user input to a value (e.g. the correct password). The easiest is to have a line like this:

if (user_input == 'password'){
  win()
}

If the code is written this way, then the actual password string will be stored in the program. The utility, 'strings', is used for reading all strings within a program or file. 

$ strings ./reverse1 | less

In the 'less' terminal, search for the prompt "Enter the Password" or response "Fail" to find strings around that same area.

:/Fail

Enter the Password:
Str1ngsAr3Fr13nds
Pass! The password is the flag.
Fail!

Enter the password: Str1ngsAr3Fr13nds

Pass! The password is the flag.
