Once logged in type <strong>ls</strong>, this will list the contents of the current directory you are in. If you'd like to see which directory you are currently in, your current working directory, type <strong>pwd</strong>. To change the directory you are in use the command <strong>cd</strong> to change your directory. Below is a list of common system navigation commands that can be used to roam the system.

As you have completed the first challenge simply by loging in, there should be a file already in your directory called flags.txt. When you complete a challenge, a new flag should appear within the flags.txt file within 60 seconds of completion. **
